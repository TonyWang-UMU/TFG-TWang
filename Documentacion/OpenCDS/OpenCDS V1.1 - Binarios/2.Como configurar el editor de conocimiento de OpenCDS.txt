=======================================

To setup OpenCDS knowledge editor(Drools Guvnor) in JBoss Application Server:

     - Follow the instructions in the Project Documents / OpenCDS Developer Workstation 
     Configuration Instructions for 1.1 Release.doc to set up JBoss Drools in JBoss AS 
     v7.0.2 or v7.1.1 or newer.  
          NOTE: JBoss Application Server is required to develop BPMN2 / Oryx Business
		Processes in Guvnor.  If you intend to use processes, then you MUST
		use JBoss Application Server.  We have not been able to use Tomcat with
		jBPM, although they say it can be done.  If you want to try, then you will
		probably want to study the jBPM documentation at section 10.5 of
		http://docs.jboss.org/jbpm/v5.3/userguide/

To setup OpenCDS knowledge editor(Drools Guvnor) in Tomcat:

     - Follow the instructions in the Project Documents / OpenCDS Developer Workstation 
     Configuration Instructions for 1.1 Release.doc to set up JBoss Drools in Tomcat v6 
	 or v7. 
          NOTE:  The latest BPMN2 / Oryx Business Processes are not currently supported 
		  in Guvnor running under Tomcat, unless you modify the default Tomcat
		  setup to include additional jars required by the Designer.

=======================================

- Start servlet container (either Tomcat or JBoss, whichever you configured).

- Open Web browser (IE version 8.x, Firefox 13.x, etc.).

	NOTE: Firefox 13.x works out of the box.

	NOTE2: IE version 8.x requires the additional installation of Google Frames 
		before it will support the jBPM GUI for processes.

	NOTE3: On slower machines, JBoss may timeout deploying drools-guvnor.war and 
		designer.war.  You will need to modify the JBoss configuration in
		standalone.xml to increase the timeout.

	NOTE4: JBoss will need additional configuration if you run it anywhere other
		than localhost, or you want to control what users can logon.  See the
		JBoss userguide for more info.

- Go to http://localhost:8080/drools-guvnor/org.drools.guvnor.Guvnor/Guvnor.jsp 
(substituting the correct port if you did not use the default, and substituting the 
correct server name if you installed somewhere other than on your local machine).
	NOTE: If you are using the Designer with jBPM processes, you must use port 8080,
		or make a number of configuration changes to settings stored within the
		Guvnor and Designer war files.  See section 10.5 of the jBPMN installation
		guide at: http://docs.jboss.org/jbpm/v5.3/userguide/ 

- Log in with any user name, blank password

- Download the appropriate version of "repository_export.zip" from this website and 
import it into Guvnor via Administration --> Import/Export.  

	NOTE: this will overwrite any existing Guvnor knowledge repositories -- export a backup 
	copy first if you need to.  ID and password can be left blank if prompted.
