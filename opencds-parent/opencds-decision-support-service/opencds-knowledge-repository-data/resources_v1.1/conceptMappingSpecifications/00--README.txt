Directory structure and content semantics is as follows:

conceptMappingSpecifications
	autoGeneratedMappings -- maintained elsewhere (e.g., Apelon).  If file of same name exists during update, the previous will be replaced by the newer automated mapping.
	manualMappings -- maintained manually
	
	At runtime, mappings from both are loaded.  If files with overlapping content exist within one or both directories, all non-duplicative mapping contents are merged. 

Concept mapping file names:
CodeSystemName^ConceptName^MethodologyName__CodeSystemOID^ConceptCode^MethodologyCode

CodeSystemName should be the one specified in openCDSCodeSystems.xml.  Other names should be the ones specified in supportedConceptsConfigurationFile.xml.

E.g.,
CPT4^Bilateral^NQF__2.16.840.1.113883.6.12^C51^C45

Names are meant to be able to be changed with no semantic consequences.

If names include characters that are not allowed in a file name (e.g., / ? : * " > < |), any substitute can be used.  As a convention, these characters should be replaced by a blank space (" ").  Note that file names are for convenience of human consumption and are not used semantically by the system.

If a manualMapping is supplemental to an auto-generated mapping, the use of "Supplemental_" as a prefix is suggested.
